## Angular 2 Code Review

**Epicodus JS Week 2**

By **Oskar Radon**

#### Description
A meal tracker app using Angular 2.

A user will be able to:

 - Log a food I have eaten by submitting a form with its name, calories and details.
 - View a list of only the names of the foods I have logged, and I want to be able to click on a name to view the details and calories for that food.
 - View either all foods, only unhealthy foods that are more than 300 calories, or only healthy foods that are less than 300 calories.
 - Click on a food and then edit its name, details or calories in case I decide to pretend my fries were only 100 calories instead of 365 calories.

Angular2, Bower, Node, TypeScript
